# OWASP Nest – API Documentation Cleanup

## Goal

Contribute to the OWASP Nest project by improving and clarifying API documentation, starting with
documenting existing endpoints based on the live OpenAPI view rather than reading Django Ninja code directly.

## Scope (initial)

- Identify a small set of high-value endpoints.
- Compare behavior visible in OpenAPI to existing docs (if any).
- Propose or implement clearer API docs:
  - Purpose
  - Auth/permissions
  - Inputs/outputs
  - Example requests/responses

## Current status

- Local Nest environment runs successfully.
- OpenAPI / Swagger UI is accessible and lists available endpoints.
- Next step: choose 1–3 endpoints to document first.
