# OWASP Nest – Local Setup Notes

- Cloned OWASP Nest repo.
- Installed Python deps (…).
- Configured environment variables (…).
- Ran migrations / initial setup.
- Started dev server and verified:
  - App loads.
  - OpenAPI/Swagger UI displays API surface.

Notes:
- Any weirdness or troubleshooting goes here so I can reproduce the setup quickly later.
