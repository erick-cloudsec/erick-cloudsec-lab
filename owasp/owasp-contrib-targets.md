# OWASP Contrib Targets

Add OWASP contribution targets here (service names, repos, contacts). Use bullet lists and include owners where possible.

## Issue #1892 – CSRF TOC update (ON HOLD)

- Status: HELP_WANTED + ACK_OBTAINED, but comments say it’s blocked until a related merge lands.
- Why I like it: focuses on structure/TOC and clarity, not deep new content.
- Action for now: wait for maintainers to clear the “blocked” note, then comment offering to help.
