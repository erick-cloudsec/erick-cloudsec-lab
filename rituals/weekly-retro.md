## Week 1 Retro (2025-11-17 to 2025-11-23)

**1. What did I ship this week?**

- Stood up a new AWS personal lab account.  
- Locked down root (MFA on, no root access keys) and created an admin IAM user with MFA.  
- Configured a multi-Region CloudTrail trail to S3.  
- Enabled AWS Config (all resource types, continuous recording).  
- Enabled GuardDuty and Security Hub with CIS AWS Foundations.  
- Created the public GitHub repo `erick-cloudsec-lab` with docs and Week 1 evidence screenshots.  
- Downloaded CSA Security Guidance v5 and the CCSK exam prep kit and read Domains 1 and 5.  
- Completed and passed the “AWS Security Fundamentals (Second Edition)” course.

**2. What moved me closer to Cloud/AppSec Architect interviews?**

- I have an AWS lab started where I can continue to experiment and learn.  
- I now have a working AWS security baseline I can demo and talk through.  
- I have a public GitHub repo that shows real hands-on work, not just theory.  
- CCSK Domains 1 & 5 plus AWS Security Fundamentals gave me the language to connect what I built to cloud security concepts.

**3. What felt heavy or draining?**

- Trying to keep both the “what” and the “how to” specifics of AWS straight, since a lot of it is new to me.  
- I’m hoping that with more practice reps it will become increasingly second nature.

**4. What will I do less of next week?**

- Fewer long, late-night AWS sessions when I’m already fried.  
- Less trying to configure multiple new services in one sitting; more small, focused blocks.

**5. One win to celebrate**

- I went from no lab to a real AWS security baseline plus a public repo plus passing AWS Security Fundamentals in a single week.

**6. Top 1–2 priorities for next week**

- Review top Security Hub CIS findings and pick 1–2 controls to improve in the lab.  
- Start exploring possible OWASP projects I could realistically contribute to.
