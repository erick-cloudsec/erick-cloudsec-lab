# CCSK Progress Log (Running)

## Week 9 — CCSK (Jan 19–Jan 25, 2026)

### Progress (completed / in progress only)
- [x] Unit 2: Cloud Computing Models
- [x] Unit 3: Reference & Architecture Models
- [x] Unit 4: Cloud Security Scope, Responsibilities, & Models
- [x] Domain 1 Conclusion

### Key takeaways (3)
- Service and deployment models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS; public/private/hybrid/multi-cloud) define your control surface: you trade control and visibility for speed and managed responsibility.
- Reference and architecture models (including overlapping/XaaS patterns) help you reason about trust boundaries and shared services so you don’t accidentally create “flat” architectures that are hard to secure.
- Shared responsibility remains the anchor: providers secure the underlying cloud, while customers must secure configuration, identity/access, data protection, and monitoring — and should follow security frameworks/patterns with a simple, repeatable security process.

## Week 8 — CCSK (Jan 12–Jan 18, 2026)

### Progress (completed / in progress only)
- [x] Domain 1 Introduction
- [x] Unit 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Key takeaways (3)
- Cloud computing is defined by traits like on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.
- The benefits (speed + elasticity + pay-for-usage) only pay off if you design and govern for them (right-sizing, visibility, and intentional configuration).
- Shared responsibility is the anchor: providers secure the underlying cloud infrastructure, while customers are responsible for secure configuration and access controls in their cloud environment.
