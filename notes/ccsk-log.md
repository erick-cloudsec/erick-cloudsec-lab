# CCSK Progress Log (Running)

## Week 8 — CCSK (Jan 12–Jan 18, 2026)

### Progress (completed / in progress only)
- [x] Domain 1 Introduction
- [x] Unit 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Key takeaways (3)
- Cloud computing is defined by traits like on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.
- The benefits (speed + elasticity + pay-for-usage) only pay off if you design and govern for them (right-sizing, visibility, and intentional configuration).
- Shared responsibility is the anchor: providers secure the underlying cloud infrastructure, while customers are responsible for secure configuration and access controls in their cloud environment.
