### Domain 2 – Governance, Risk, and Compliance (takeaways)

**Key ideas**
- Org needs a clear security governance model: policies, roles, decision-making.
- Risk management is ongoing: identify, assess, treat, and monitor risks (not one-time).
- Compliance is about demonstrating controls + evidence, not just having tools.

**How it shows up in my lab**
- CloudTrail + Config + Security Hub + GuardDuty = concrete technical controls that support governance requirements.
- CloudWatch.2/3 alarms + tuning + GitHub docs = “evidence” and continuous monitoring story.
- Tuning noisy alarms is part of making controls usable in real orgs (less ivory-tower, more real life).

**Personal reaction**
- Conceptually familiar from working in regulated, high-security environments.
- Feels a bit PMBOK-like: idealized vs how things actually run day-to-day.
- More energized by applied, hands-on controls and detection than by governance process design.
